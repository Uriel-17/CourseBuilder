# CoursePlanner
 
A program that takes in a text file with different teachers for classes that will then organize them by two keys which are rating or course number (CRN). Note: this project uses LinkedList, HashTable, and two different Binary Search Tree's. The HashTable is organized by the first key as well as the first BST, however the second BST is organized by the second key.
